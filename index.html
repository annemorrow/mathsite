    <h1>Online Math Exercises</h1>
    <p>I had the privilege of serving with the <a href="http://www.denvermathfellows.com/">Denver Math Fellows</a> for two years.  The following are computerized versions of some of the games and exercises we shared with our students.  This page is dedicated to the Denver Math Fellows, and it is my hope that some of the current fellows will find this site useful in their ongoing work.
    
    <div class="list-group">
      <a href="twelve/twelve.html" class="list-group-item">
        <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Get to Twelve</h4>
        <p class="list-group-item-text">Like the game 24, but with 12 as the goal.  Not all puzzles are solvable, but think hard before you hit "skip".  This game is designed to improve quick fact fluency.</p>
      </a>
      <a href="percents/percents.html" class="list-group-item">
        <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Percents of a Different Whole</h4>
        <p class="list-group-item-text">Why is 50% of 80 equal to 40 and 50% of 12 equal to 6?  Choose a percent and a total to get a goal number.  This game is designed to familiarize students with quick mental tricks to find common percents.</p>
      </a>
      <a href="threeinarow/threeinarow.html" class="list-group-item">
        <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Three Fractions in a Row</h4>
        <p class="list-group-item-text">This game needs to be played with a partner.  Take turns choosing fractions from a list.  Your goal is to get three fractions in a row on the number line before your partner does.  This game is designed to build intuition about relative sizes of fractions.</p>
      </a>
      <a href="dimanalysis/diman.html" class="list-group-item">
        <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Dimensional Analysis</h4>
        <p class="list-group-item-text">Currently more of a tool than a game, although a game component will be added later, instantly see the result of multiplying conversion factors to convert units.  This tool comes preloaded with commonly used conversion factors, such as feet to inches, as well as giving the option of creating problem-specific conversion factors, such as how much someone gets paid per hour.</p>
